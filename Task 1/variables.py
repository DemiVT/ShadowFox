# 1. Create a variable named pi and store the value 22/7 in it
pi = 22 / 7
print("Value of pi:", pi)
print("Data type of pi:", type(pi))

# 2. Create a variable called 'for' and assign it a value 4
# Note: 'for' is a reserved keyword in Python, so using it as a variable name will raise a syntax error
# Uncommenting the following line will result in a SyntaxError
# for = 4

# 3. Calculate Simple Interest
principal = 1000  # Example principal amount
rate_of_interest = 5  # Example rate of interest
time = 3  # Time in years
simple_interest = (principal * rate_of_interest * time) / 100
print("Simple Interest:", simple_interest)
