## Overview

This repository contains implementations for various tasks, including a web scraper, a hangman game, and data analysis projects using Jupyter notebooks. The aim is to showcase skills in web scraping, game development, data analysis, and natural language processing.

## Contents

1. **Web Scraper** - Extracts data from websites using Beautiful Soup.
2. **Hangman Game** - A word-guessing game with visual progress and hints.
3. **Data Analysis in Jupyter Notebook** - Analyze a dataset of choice and visualize insights.
4. **AI-Driven NLP Project** - Utilize a Language Model (LM) to generate text and analyze its capabilities.

## Task 1: Web Scraper

**`web_scraper.py`**

This script uses Beautiful Soup and requests to scrape data from a specified website and save it to a CSV file.

### Usage

1. Ensure you have `beautifulsoup4` and `requests` installed:
   ```bash
   pip install beautifulsoup4 requests
   ```
2. Replace `'https://shadowfox.example.com'` with the URL you want to scrape in the script.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python web_scraper.py
   ```

### Features

- Sends an HTTP request to the specified URL.
- Parses HTML content to extract titles (customizable).
- Saves the data to a CSV file.
- Handles errors gracefully.

## Task 2: Hangman Game

**`hangman.py`**

This script implements a word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a hidden word.

### Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python hangman.py
   ```

### Features

- Chooses a random word from a predefined list.
- Displays the hangman figure and partially revealed word.
- Prompts the player for letter guesses.
- Updates the display based on correct or incorrect guesses.
- Allows the player to play again after the game concludes.

## Task 3: Jupyter Notebook Data Analysis

**`data_analysis.ipynb`**

This Jupyter Notebook performs data analysis and visualization on a dataset of choice.

### Usage

1. Install Jupyter Notebook if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```
2. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook data_analysis.ipynb
   ```
3. Replace `'your_dataset.csv'` with your dataset file.
4. Customize and run cells to perform analysis and visualizations.

### Features

- Loads and displays dataset information.
- Performs example visualizations such as histograms and correlation matrices.
- Provides a template for further analysis.

## Task 4: AI-Driven Natural Language Processing Project

**`lm_analysis.ipynb`**

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the use of a language model (LM) for text generation and analysis.

### Usage

1. Install the `transformers` library:
   ```bash
   pip install transformers
   ```
2. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook lm_analysis.ipynb
   ```
3. Customize the model and prompts as needed.
4. Run cells to generate text and analyze LM capabilities.

### Features

- Loads a pre-trained language model.
- Generates and analyzes text based on various prompts.
